/*

Given a binary string S consisting of 0s and 1s. 
The task is to find the maximum difference of the number of 0s and the number of 1s (number of 0s â€“ number of 1s) 
in the substrings of a string.

Note: In the case of all 1s, the answer will be -1.

Example:

Input: S = "11000010001" 
Output: 6 

Explanation: From index 2 to index 9, there are 7 0s and 1 1s, so number of 0s - number of 1s is 6.
